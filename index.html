            Shane Keith Warne (13 September 1969 ‚Äì 4 March 2022) was an Australian cricketer. A right-arm leg spinner, he is widely considered one of the greatest bowlers in cricket history,and in 2000 he was selected by a panel of cricket experts as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Century, the only specialist bowler selected in the quintet, and the only one still playing at the time.

            Warne played his first Test match in 1992 and took more than 1,000 wickets in Tests and One Day Internationals (ODIs).Warne's 708 Test wickets was the record for the most wickets taken by any bowler in Test cricket until 2007.He was named one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in the 1994 Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, and was the Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World in 1997 and 2004.A useful lower-order batsman, Warne scored more than 3,000 Test runs.As well as playing internationally, Warne played domestic cricket for his home state of Victoria and English domestic cricket for Hampshire. He was captain of Hampshire for three seasons from 2005 to 2007. His career was plagued by scandals off the field, including a ban from cricket for testing positive for a prohibited substance, charges of bringing the game into disrepute by accepting money from bookmakers and sexual indiscretions.
            
            Warne retired from international cricket in January 2007 at the end of Australia's 5‚Äì0 Ashes series victory over England. Three other players integral to the Australian team at the time‚ÄîGlenn McGrath, Damien Martyn and Justin Langer‚Äîalso retired from Tests at the same time, which led some, including the Australian captain Ricky Ponting, to declare it the "end of an era".
